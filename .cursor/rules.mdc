## Architecture & Code Quality
- Use named exports only; do not use default exports.
- Export all public API members at the end of each file.
- Put each React context in its own file.
- Expose each context via a dedicated hook; do not read context directly in components.
- Use that hook as the only way to read the context value.

## Design Principles
- Apply the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Keep code DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself).

## TypeScript & Types
- Use of `any` is strictly prohibited; use proper types or `unknown` instead.

## Code Documentation
- Add IntelliSense-friendly comments for every component, hook, and function.
- Document each member of types, props, and argument objects with a short comment.
- Add a brief comment for every function parameter.
- Check spelling in identifiers, comments, documentation, and tests.

## README.md Documentation
- Keep docs aimed at developers and focused on how to use the project.
- Use simple, clear English.
- Include code examples when they help understanding.
- Prefer realistic, production-like examples.
- Check spelling in README text, headings, and code samples.
- Do not add manual line breaks for layout; use the project’s formatter.
- Prefer neutral, descriptive wording; avoid addressing the reader as “you”.

## Testing
- Maintain 100% test coverage.
- Start every test description with a capital letter.
- Each test case should assert one behavior.
- In tests, assert default behavior first, then custom or edge cases.

## Naming
- Use dash-case for file names.
- Prefix type aliases with `T`.
- Suffix props types with `Props`.
- Suffix function argument types with `TArgs`.
- Use a `-context` suffix for context files (e.g. `story-configuration-context.tsx`).
- Use a `-provider` suffix for provider files (e.g. `story-configuration-provider.tsx`).
- Use a `Context` suffix for React context values (e.g. `StoryConfigurationContext`).
- Use a `Provider` suffix for provider names (e.g. `StoryConfigurationProvider`).

## Components
- Define and export a dedicated props type for every component, hook, and function.
- Use `<React.Fragment>` instead of the `<>` shorthand.
