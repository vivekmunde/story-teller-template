## Architecture & Code Quality
- Use named exports only.
- Export all intended public members at the end of each file.
- Declare each React context in its own dedicated file.
- Create a dedicated hook that returns each context value.
- Read context values only through their dedicated hooks.

## Design Principles
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Follow DRY (Do not repeat yourself).

## Code Documentation
- Add IDE IntelliSense-friendly comments and descriptions for every component, hook, and function.
- Document every member of a type, props object, or argument object with a clear comment.
- Add a clear comment for every function argument.
- Always verify spelling in identifiers, comments, docs, and tests.

## README.md Documentation
- Keep documentation developer-friendly and focused on practical usage.
- Use simple, clear English that is easy to understand.
- Provide code examples where they improve understanding.
- Prefer realistic, production-like examples.
- Always verify spelling in README content, headings, and code samples.
- Avoid adding line breaks only for formatting; rely on project formatting settings.
- Avoid using the word "you"; use neutral, descriptive phrasing instead.

## Testing
- Maintain 100% test coverage.
- Start every test case description with a capital letter.
- Ensure each test case validates a single behavior.
- In tests, validate default behavior first, then cover custom values.

## Naming
- Use dash-case for file names.
- Prefix all type aliases with `T`.
- Suffix all props types with `Props`.
- Suffix all function argument types with `TArgs`.
- Name context files with a `-context` suffix (e.g., `story-configuration-context.tsx`).
- Name provider files with a `-provider` suffix (e.g., `story-configuration-provider.tsx`).
- Name React context values with a `Context` suffix (e.g., `StoryConfigurationContext`).
- Name providers with a `Provider` suffix (e.g., `StoryConfigurationProvider`).

## Components
- Define and export a dedicated props type for every component, hook, and function.
- Use `<React.Fragment>` instead of `<>` fragments.
